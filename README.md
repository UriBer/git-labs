# git-labs
git lab for learning git concepts and commands
What the Lab Includes:

##Core Git Operations:
•  Repository cloning and initial setup
•  Basic operations: add, commit, push
•  Branch management: creating branches, switching between them
•  Creating branches from other branches
•  Merging branches with different scenarios

##Advanced Scenarios:
•  Conflict creation and resolution - Intentionally creating merge conflicts and learning to resolve them manually
•  Commit history management - Using git revert to undo changes
•  Tagging operations - Creating lightweight and annotated tags, pushing tags to remote

##Best Practices:
•  Real-world workflow examples
•  Troubleshooting common issues
•  Verification steps to ensure learning
•  Summary of all commands learned

##Key Features:

1. Step-by-Step Instructions - Every command is explained with expected outputs
2. Practical Examples - Uses a real Python application that evolves throughout the lab
3. Conflict Resolution - Teaches how to handle merge conflicts properly
4. Complete Workflow - From initial setup to final cleanup
5. Comprehensive Coverage - All the operations you requested are included

##How to Use the Lab:

1. Prerequisites: You'll need Git installed and a GitHub account
2. Start with Setup: Follow the initial setup to create a practice repository
3. Work Through Sections: Each section builds on the previous one
4. Practice Commands: All commands are ready to copy and paste
5. Learn by Doing: The lab creates real scenarios you'll encounter in development

The lab is designed to be completed in about 2-3 hours and will give you hands-on experience with all essential Git CLI operations. Each section includes explanations of what's happening and why, making it both educational and practical.
