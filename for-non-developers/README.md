## 🎯 What is This?

A **practical, hands-on Git tutorial** designed specifically for **non-developers** who need to understand and use Git for project management, documentation, and collaboration. No programming experience required!

Instead of learning Git through code examples, you'll learn through **real-world business scenarios** like:
- 📋 Managing project plans and requirements
- 📝 Creating meeting templates and documentation
- 🔄 Testing different project methodologies (Agile vs Traditional vs Hybrid)
- 👥 Collaborating on documents without version conflicts
- 📈 Tracking changes and maintaining project history

## 👥 Who This Lab Is For

### Perfect for:
- **Project Managers** working with development teams
- **Technical Writers** and documentation specialists  
- **Content Creators** and editors
- **Business Analysts** and product managers
- **Team Members** who want to understand what developers do with Git
- **Anyone** who needs to collaborate on files and track changes

### You'll Love This If You:
- ❌ Are tired of files named `Document_v1_final_FINAL_for_real_this_time.docx`
- ❌ Have experienced the "email attachment nightmare" when collaborating
- ❌ Want to understand how development teams manage changes
- ❌ Need a better way to track document versions and collaboration
- ❌ Feel intimidated by Git tutorials full of programming code

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

By the end of this lab, you'll confidently know how to:

### Core Skills
- ✅ **Set up your digital project workspace** (cloning repositories)
- ✅ **Track changes in documents** (better than "Track Changes" in Word!)
- ✅ **Work on different versions simultaneously** (branches for different ideas)
- ✅ **Collaborate without overwriting each other's work** (merging)
- ✅ **Handle conflicts when multiple people edit the same thing** (conflict resolution)
- ✅ **Go back to previous versions** (better than "Save As" with dates!)
- ✅ **Create milestones and releases** (tagging important versions)
- ✅ **Follow best practices for team collaboration**

### Git Commands You'll Master
```bash
# Basic workflow
git status, git add, git commit, git push, git pull

# Branching and collaboration  
git branch, git checkout, git merge

# History and recovery
git log, git revert, git reset

# Tagging and releases
git tag, git push --tags

# Advanced collaboration
git fetch, git stash, git remote
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required
- **Git installed** on your computer (we'll help you check and install)
- **GitHub account** (free to create)
- **Basic computer skills** (creating folders, editing text files)

### NOT Required
- ❌ Programming experience
- ❌ Technical background
- ❌ Previous Git knowledge

## 💡 Learning Philosophy

### Why This Lab Is Different

**Traditional Git Tutorials:**
```bash
git add app.py
git commit -m "Fix bug in authentication module"
git push origin feature/oauth-integration
```
*"What's an authentication module? What's OAuth?"* 😕

**This Lab:**
```bash
git add project-plan.md
git commit -m "Add initial project plan with goals and timeline"
git push origin main
```
*"I understand exactly what I just did!"* 😊

### Key Principles
1. **Learn by doing** - Every concept includes hands-on practice
2. **Business context** - All examples relate to real work scenarios
3. **No assumptions** - We explain everything in plain language
4. **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, build up to advanced topics
5. **Practical outcomes** - You'll have real skills you can use immediately

## 🆘 Getting Help
